I am a software developer, cat enthusiast, and a geek in general living in The
Netherlands. I primarily work with Ruby, Rust, and at times I also (reluctantly)
use C/C++. I'm currently employed by [GitLab][gitlab] where I work on improving
performance of GitLab. I am currently **not** interested in any job offers.

In my spare time I mostly work on free and open source software. Some of these
projects include (but are not limited to):

* [Rubinius][rubinius]: an implementation of the Ruby programming language
* [Oga][oga]: an XML/HTML parser for Ruby with XPath and CSS support
* [ruby-ll][ruby-ll]: an LL(1) parser generator for Ruby
* [ruby-lint][ruby-lint]: a static code analysis tool for Ruby, capable of
  detecting undefined methods, incorrect type usage, etc
* [rubysl][rubysl]: Ruby standard library for Rubinius, most notably
  [rubysl-socket][rubysl-socket] which is a pure Ruby implementation of the Ruby
  Socket standard library.
* [Aeon][aeon]: a gradually typed, interpreted programming language inspired by
  Ruby and Smalltalk with a Rust based virtual machine.

In the past I've also worked on [OpeNER][opener], [Ramaze][ramaze], [Pry][pry]
and various other, smaller projects. I'm also an avid practitioner of Krav Maga,
prior to that I practised Wing Chun Kung Fu and Taekwondo.
