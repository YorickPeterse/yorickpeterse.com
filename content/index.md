I am a programmer and general geek living in The Netherlands. My primary
language of choice is Ruby, although I'm also proficient in other languages such
as C/C++, JavaScript, and Rust.

I'm currently employed by [GitLab][gitlab] where I work on improving performance
of GitLab as well as improving Rubinius in general. I am currently not
interested in any job offers. I also don't do business with recruiters, so
please don't bother contacting me if you're a recruiter.

In my spare time I mostly work on free and open source software. Currently I
actively work on the following projects:

* [Rubinius][rubinius]: an implementation of the Ruby programming language
* [Oga][oga]: an XML/HTML parser for Ruby with XPath and CSS support
* [ruby-ll][ruby-ll]: an LL(1) parser generator for Ruby
* [ruby-lint][ruby-lint]: a static code analysis tool for Ruby, capable of
  detecting undefined methods, incorrect type usage, etc

In the past I've also worked on [OpeNER][opener], [Ramaze][ramaze], [Pry][pry]
and various other, smaller projects. I'm also an avid practitioner of Krav Maga,
prior to that I practised Taekwondo and Wing Chun Kung Fu.

If you happen to have any questions or would simply like to contact me you can
do so by [Email](mailto:yorickpeterse@gmail.com). You can also find me on
[Github][github], [Twitter][twitter] and [Reddit][reddit].
