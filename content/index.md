I am a programmer and geek living in the Netherlands who primarily writes Ruby
code along with a mixture of various other languages such as Javascript and
Python. Over the course of time I've contributed to projects such as
[Ramaze][ramaze] and [Pry][pry] as well as having written plenty of open source
code myself such as a [static code analysis tool/linter for Ruby][ruby-lint].

If you happen to have any questions or would simply like to contact me you can
do so by [Email](mailto:yorickpeterse@gmail.com). You can also find me on
websites such as [Github][github], [Twitter][twitter] and [Reddit][reddit]. I
am currently not interested in any job offers.

My GPG public key is `3649F444` registered using Email address
yorickpeterse@gmail.com. Other keys registered on my name are no longer in
use.
