I am a programmer and geek living in the Netherlands who primarily writes Ruby
code along with a mixture of various other languages such as Javascript and
Python. Over the course of time I've contributed to projects such as
[Ramaze][ramaze], [Pry][pry] and [Rubinius][rubinius]. I also work on various
personal projects such as [ruby-lint][ruby-lint], a static code analysis tool
for Ruby, and [Oga][oga], a pure Ruby XML/HTML parser.

If you happen to have any questions or would simply like to contact me you can
do so by [Email](mailto:yorickpeterse@gmail.com). You can also find me on
websites such as [Github][github], [Twitter][twitter] and [Reddit][reddit].

I am currently happily employed by [Olery][olery]. Although I appreciate the
interest I am not interested in job offers at the moment.
