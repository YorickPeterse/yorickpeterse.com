I am a programmer and general geek living in The Netherlands. While my primary
language is Ruby I also tend to use other languages such as Python, C/C++ and
JavaScript.

I'm currently employed by [Olery][olery] where I happily write Ruby code and
occasionally curse at MongoDB. Although I appreciate the interest I am not
interested in job offers at the moment.

In my spare time I mostly work on free, open source software such as
[Rubinius][rubinius], [ruby-lint][ruby-lint], [Oga][oga] and others. In the past
I've also worked on [Ramaze][ramaze], [Pry][pry] and various other, smaller
projects.

If you happen to have any questions or would simply like to contact me you can
do so by [Email](mailto:yorickpeterse@gmail.com). You can also find me on
[Github][github], [Twitter][twitter] and [Reddit][reddit].

My GPG public key is [EB691AC9][gpg-key] registered using Email address
yorickpeterse@gmail.com. Other keys registered on my name are no longer in use.
